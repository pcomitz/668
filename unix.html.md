### Unix for your gl account **Tutorial1<a id="hw1" name="hw1"></a>** * You need to learn how to logon to your umbc gl account. You use an SCP client (FTP also works but is not preferred) to transfer files to your account from your PC and you use an SSH client to get command-line access to your gl account. * You need to learn these unix commands that you can use up on your gl account at the command-line. * Use this [tutorial one](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) for the commands.

* See also the [tuorial five](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) (5.1 and 5.2 only) for ls -l and chmod. * Also be sure to learn ssh, scp, and the [pico](http://www.itd.umich.edu/itcsdocs/r1168/) (or [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) - it is the same editor) text editor. Ask any questions on the forum. * Another handy command is [wget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget). It allows you to get a file using HTTP from a web server from the command line. **Tutorial2<a id="hw2" name="hw2"></a>** * You will need to learn these additional unix commands. * Use this [tutorial two](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) for the commands.
